# AlgoInTrackingCV
This is a open source project about the popular algorithms of Tracking in Computer Vision domain, written by Python.

As a student, I would like to use PyTorch and more maths knowledge to model popular algorithms clearly.

## Transformer
We will talk about these following problems.
1. What are Transformer and attention mechanisms?
